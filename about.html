    <h1>About My Game Development Journey</h1>

    <p>
        I'm a lifetime gamer diving head-first into game development with nothing but a laptop, 
        passion, and big expectations. I have no funding, no team — just grit and a drive to create 
        something awesome.
    </p>

    <p>
        My focus is on RTS gameplay with medium to high-quality visuals. This page serves as a place 
        to preview assets I create, showcase development progress, and track my evolution as a new developer.
    </p>

    <p>
        Everything here is built from scratch as I learn, improve, and push myself to build fun and unique 
        experiences for players.
