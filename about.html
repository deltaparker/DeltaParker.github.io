        <h1>About Delta Parker Productions</h1>

        <p>
            Delta Parker Productions is a one-man, self-taught game development project created from a 
            lifetime passion for gaming. I’ve been playing games for as long as I can remember, and now 
            I’m finally taking the leap into building my own worlds — armed with nothing more than a 
            laptop, determination, and the belief that great ideas come from anywhere.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website serves as a development hub where I share my progress, showcase assets I create, 
            and document the entire journey from concept to playable experience. Everything here — 
            characters, environments, mechanics, and tools — is part of the ongoing effort to bring 
            my visions to life.
        </p>

        <p>
            My primary focus is <strong>RTS gameplay</strong>, aiming for <strong>medium to high-quality</strong> production values. 
            I want to build strategy games that feel intense, immersive, and fun. Games with depth, 
            replayability, and personality — the kind of games I grew up loving.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have <strong>no outside funding</strong> and no formal team behind me. It's just me, learning, experimenting, 
            and pushing forward every day. I’m going in head-first with the goal of delivering something 
            I’m proud of and something players will enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you for following the journey. Your support means everything.
